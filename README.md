# Image Processing Utilities

This repository contains Python utilities for advanced image processing techniques including contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and adaptive equalization. It leverages libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-image to manipulate and visualize images in various color spaces.

## Features

- **Contrast Stretching**: Enhances the contrast of an image by adjusting its intensity range.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Improves the contrast of an image by redistributing its intensity levels.
- **Adaptive Equalization**: Applies histogram equalization locally to various sections of an image, improving contrast in areas with lower local contrast.
- **Color Space Conversion**: Includes utility for converting RGB images to the YCbCr color space.

## Requirements

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-image

## Installation

To use these utilities, you will need to install the required Python packages. You can install all required packages by running:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-image
```

## Usage

First, import the necessary modules from the script:

```python
from zaid import plot_img_and_hist, rgb_to_ycbcr
```

Then, you can load your image and apply the provided functions as demonstrated in the script. Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
from skimage import io
from zaid import rgb_to_ycbcr, plot_img_and_hist

# Load your image
img_path = 'path/to/your/image.jpg'
img = io.imread(img_path)

# Convert the image to YCbCr color space
img_ycbcr = rgb_to_ycbcr(img)

# Now, you can apply other processing functions as shown in the script
```
